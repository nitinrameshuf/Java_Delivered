Project 1
Name: OnePass

Impact: High

Problem solved: 
Java based solution to calculate standard deviation in OnePass.

Challenge: 
1) Server needs two passes through the entire data set to calculate Standard deviation (SD) as per the SD formula.
2) Input data sets are of size greater than 10GB.
2) Two pass through large datasets are time consuming, need to calculate in one pass without storing in memory.

Solution Implemented:
1) Used Welford's technique from Donald Knuck's 1962 publication. Customized the solution and implemented with very low memory overhead.

Project 2:
Name: GoAlchoholGo App

Research Paper: https://github.com/nitinrameshuf/Research-Papers/blob/main/Alcohol_Behavior_Mod_Paper.pdf

Impact: Medium

Problem solved: 
Java based solution to detect sobriety via on-board sensors.

Challenge: 
1) Establishing thresholds using sensor data in Java and detecting patterns in future movement.

Solution Implemented:
1) Monitored long term sensor data reading and checked aggregated threshhold values to determine sobriety levels.
2) Also implemented other functionality in the app like Rewards, Tracking timers, Reminder functionality etc.

Project 3:
Name: Consumer Banking SC

Type: Proprietary Software (Not accessible)

Impact: High

Problem solved: 
Java based plugins and input processing for applications using my Python Input Whitelisting module.

Challenge: 
1) Detect special characters, erroneous data and malicious input in input data from consumer and santize them by whitelisting.
2) Secure logging of data via frameworks like Log4j.
3) Alert risk management systems

Solution Implemented:
1) Implemented checking mechanish for text fields, uploaded files, data from machine to machine communication and partner systems.

Other Java Experience:

1) 6+ years experience in SAST source code review of Java based source code for security vulnerabilities. 
2) Utilized multiple CI/CD security tools like Blackduck SCA, SAST tools like Checkmarx, Fortify, Appscan source etc.
